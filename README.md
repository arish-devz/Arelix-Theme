## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does this replace my existing theme?**
A: Yes, this will overwrite your current Pterodactyl theme files. We recommend backing up your `resources` folder first, though the installer creates a backup automatically.

**Q: How do I update?**
A: You can use the **Update** button in the admin or just re-run the `install.sh` script using the commands above.

**Q: Is it compatible with the latest Pterodactyl?**
A: Yes, it is designed for the standard Pterodactyl 1.x series.
